# NYSE Data Analysis

## Introduction

In this project I analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. 

The goal is to perform an analysis and create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.


## <b>Data set</b><br>

The data set used is a subset of a large data set provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.

The used data set is a clean data set that derived from the _fundamentals.csv_ and _securities.csv_ files provided by Kaggle. The _fundamentals_ file provided the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The _securities_ file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

The following information is included in the _projectdata-nyse.csv_ file:
- __Ticker symbol__: Stock symbol
- __Years__: Number of years for which data is provided
- __Period ending__
- __Total Revenue__
- __Cost of Goods Sold__
- __Sales, General, and Administrative expenses__
- __Research and Development expenses__
- __Other Operating expense items__
- __Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector__: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
- __GICS Sub Industry__: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the "Airlines" industry.)

As a final note about the data set, although in real-life scenarios, data sets often need to be cleaned and processed before analysis can proceed, this project gives the opportunity to see what a clean data set should look like.


## <b>Used Skills</b><br>

The main goal of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to:

* Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
* Use a combination of Excel functions (indicatively: IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP, OFFSET).
* Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel.
* Create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel to create a financial forecast model.


## <b>Project</b><br>

The project consists of the following:<br>

* Conducting a data analysis and creating a presentation slide to share the findings

* Creating an Excel workbook that contains the following tabs:
  * **Data Set** - It contains the raw data
  * **Summary Statistics** - It includes the calculations of the summary statistics for the presentation slide
  * **P&L Statement Dashboard** - Profit & Loss Statement Interactive Dashboard
  * **Forecast Model** - 3 forecast scenarios (_Best Case_ Scenario, _Base Case_ Scenario, _Weak Case_ Scenario) to forecast future growth prospects for **Corning Inc.** (Ticker symbol: **GLW**)
  * **Reference** - an auxiliary tab
