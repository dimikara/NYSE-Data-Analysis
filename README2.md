# NYSE Data Analysis

## Introduction

In this project I analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. The data set used is a subset of a large data set provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

The goal is to perform an analysis and create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.


## <b>Data set</b><br>

The data set is a clean data set that derived from the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

Although in real-life scenarios, data sets often need to be cleaned and processed before analysis can proceed, this project gives us the opportunity to see what a clean data set should look like.


## <b>Skills to be used</b><br>

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

* Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
* Use a combination of Excel functions (indicatively: IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP, OFFSET).
* Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel.
* Create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel to create a financial forecast model.


## <b>Project</b><br>

The project consists of the following:<br>

* Conducting a data analysis and creating a presentation file to share the findings

* Creating an Excel workbook that contains the following tabs:
  * **Data Set** - It contains the raw data
  * **Summary Statistics** - It includes the calculations of the summary statistics
  * **P&L Statement Dashboard**
  * **Forecast Model** - 3 forecast scenarios (Best Case Scenario, Base Case Scenario, Weak Case Scenario) to forecast future growth prospects for a company
  * **Reference** - an auxiliary tab
